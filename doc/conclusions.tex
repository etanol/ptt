\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Two of the most important lessons learned while designing and developing the
framework have been that, firstly, finding the balance between flexibility,
simplicity and functionality is much harder than it seems; and, secondly,
choosing the proper combination of event types and values to instrument an
application is also difficult.

The main obstacle in the design has been the nonexistence of file format
documentation from Paraver.  Specially for the PCF definitions, which could have
been much better exploited and led to better results.

On the personal side, this project has constituted a reminder for the need of
better time management policies and schedules.  But it has been fun so far.
