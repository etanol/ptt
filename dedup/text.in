1. ABOUT CANUTE
===============

Canute is a small command line utility to transfer files and directories
over the network.  It does not have authentication nor any other kind of
privileges.  It can be handy in a number of situations, specially on LAN.

For example, imagine you are with a friend and he has a big CD/DVD image
you want (whatever Linux distro).  Depending on the operating systems you
have, there are some ways of doing the copy:

   - FTP: Set up a server (you need root privileges for that) and then
     allow anonymous upload, create a new account for your friend or give
     him access using your account.  Don't forget a good FTP client

   - HTTP: Maybe handier than FTP but upload is a bit trickier.

   - SFTP/SSH: This is account based so give new accounts or your own.

   - RSync: If you want to use it two way you need to transfer over SSH,
     then you are in the same situation as before.  Otherwise both of you
     should configure a server with the appropriate modules (which, again,
     requires root privileges).

   - NFS: Hasefroch does not easily support it.  This is not as hard as it
     used to be thanks to the modern Linux distributions.  But you need at
     least two servers: the port mapper and the nfsd.  Not mentioning the
     kernel support, the permission grant from the server
     (/etc/hosts.allow), etc...   And it is quite slow for big files.

   - SMB: Very similar to NFS but slower.

   - Finally, you could also waste a CD/DVD burning that ISO image and
     giving it to your friend.

With Canute you use the same binary for all tasks: sending or receiving.
No need for installation, just the damn binary.



2. USAGE
========

There are two pairs of concepts: server-client and sender-receiver.  The
server-client couple only defines who (of the two peers) has to execute the
application first.  The sender-receiver defines the direction of the
transfer.

Let's have host A and host B.  The following scenarios show the commands
and the order in which must be executed.

==> Scenario 1.  A sends files to B.  This is the usual way of working.

host_A$ canute send file1 file2 ...
host_B$ canute get host_A

==> Scenario 2.  A sends files to B, but A is behind a firewall and cannot
    open ports (NAT/PAT)

host_B$ canute getserv
host_A$ canute sendto host_B file1 file2 ...

We see how server-client roles can be switched independently from
sender-receiver roles.  The server is the peer who waits for the client to
be connected.  The server is not persistent and the port is closed when it
finishes.  That means you do not have to worry about leaving that port
opened on your router if you want to do Internet transfers.

You can also choose a different port than the default (1121/tcp) specifying
it after the Canute sub-command, like this

host_A$ canute send:5030 file1 file2 ...
host_B$ canute get:5030 host_A

Or else:

host_B$ canute getserv:5030
host_A$ canute sendto:5030 host_B file1 file2 ...

Note that if a directory is found, in the command line, then is sent
recursively.



3. COMPILATION
==============

Canute can now compile in many UNIX flavours, as well as in Hasefroch
natively (win32) using MinGW.

The Makefile is written using some GNU Make extensions (beware *BSD users,
do not forget to use "gmake").  If you are compiling within a GNU
environment (GCC), as many open source Unices are, you do not need to do
any special tricks.  Execute "make help" to find out what you need.

Commercial UNIX variants do not offer a GNU environment, mainly because
they have their proprietary C compiler, therefore compiler flags must be
modified.  However, some commercial UNIX flavours are supported as long as
GNU Make is installed.

In particular, to compile Canute in Solaris (SunOS 5.x) and in HP-UX, it is
enough to run "gmake".  Note that OSF1 (5.1 and above) testing has been
dropped because we do not have access to any such platform anymore.  Other
flavours (like AIX) may need additional tuning.  Porting patches are
welcomed.


3.1 Hasefroch (aka: Win32)
--------------------------

As a Hasefroch average user, you are not expected to be interested in this
part because we already provide a binary.  But if you would like to patch
Canute yourself and produce binaries for Hasefroch you can easily do so
from UNIX by doing cross compilation.  Install MinGW (crossed) from your
package manager and execute:

make hase

If you want to do it in Hasefroch, get GNU Make from "Unix tools for Win32"
(http://unxutils.sourceforge.net) and MinGW.  Tune up a bit the Makefile
and compile as you like.  The Makefile is very straightforward.



4. PROTOCOL ENHANCEMENTS
========================

Version 1.2 introduces some improvements on the protocol.  The previously
reserved field in the header packet now carries some additional information
about the file being transferred.

To maintain backwards compatibility with versions 1.0 and 1.1, the last
byte of each header packet is marked with a special value.  Old versions
will ignore that mark and the new information introduced into the header
packet.

So if one of the peers is using a version below 1.2, do not expect these
added features to work.


4.1. File modification time
---------------------------

Most remote copying utilities provide a way to maintain, at least, file
modification time intact.  In general it is desirable to preserve such
information for many reasons; for example, to make a backup-like remote
copy.

An attempt to use this information to decide upon resuming transfers showed
that it is trickier than it seems at a first glance.  Therefore, the resume
policy has not been altered.

Remember, though, that Canute is NOT a mirroring nor backup software.
Nevertheless, this feature helps to make Canute friendlier to such
mirroring software.


4.2. Executable bit
-------------------

The Canute experience has also shown that in many cases, the lack of
executable bit information introduces some inconveniences.  This is
particularly annoying on large directory tree transfers.  Therefore, this
information is now sent through the connection.

The executable bit is also kind of "resumed" because it propagates.  But
the lack of it does NOT propagate.  That means once the executable bit is
set locally, subsequent resumes will not clear it.

Obviously, the use of executable bit is disabled in Hasefroch builds as it
does not make sense.



5. SOURCE CODE FILES
====================

canute.h  : Dirty tricks to make the rest of the code portable and as
            #ifdef clean as possible.

canute.c  : Main function.  Command line parsing and role selection
            (server-client, sender-receiver).

feedback.c: User feedback module, progress bar, information and timing.

net.c     : Basic network management functions.  Connection handling, block
            transfer and message passing.

protocol.c: Sender-receiver negotiations and content transfers.

util.c    : Unclassified utility functions.

2008-11-18  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v1.2

	- Improved protocol, now propagating file modification time and executable
	bit information while maintaining backwards compatibility with older
	versions.
	- Makefile now detects the host platform and adjusts some
	compilation flags accordingly, so it is no longer necessary to
	perform tricks with non-gcc compilers.  Currently supported: Solaris
	and HP-UX.

2007-05-19  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v1.1

	- Fixed a bug when giving multiple arguments on the command line.
	In some cases, the program did not return to the working directory
	correctly.
	- Progress bar now repaints at least every second, which reduces
	de number of repaints on fast connections.
	- Progress bar also can resize in the middle of a transfer.

2006-08-19  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v1.0

	- Major version update, not backwards compatible due to
	changes in protocol.
	- Automatic resume support.
	- Large file support (> 2GBytes).
	- Some fatal errors now treated as non-fatal to gain
	robustness.
	- More UNIX flavours supported. Commercial ones tested are:
	Solaris, OSF1 (5.1) and HP-UX.
	- Split of the source file to improve code management and
	readability.
	- An informative README file added to the distribution.
	- Code licensed under GPLv2.

2006-07-16  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.6

	- Modifications on time strings to make them more compact.
	- Fixed the progress bar line-jumping issue on win32.
	- Eliminated the compiler warning in function gettimeofday()
	on win32.

2006-07-02  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.5

	- More detailed feedback before and after progress bar. Thanks
	to a small code redesign.
	- Stabilized speed and ETA values after some recoded parts in
	order to find and resolve a stability bug found when
	transmitting over slow connections.
	- Cleaned some unneeded conditional code (some #ifdef's supressed).

2006-06-27  mkd  <claudiomkd@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.4.1

	- Add a small workaround for ETA calculations when the file
	size is less than two megabytes.


2006-06-26  mkd  <claudiomkd@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.4

	- New feature: A mean speed is shown after each transfer.
	- New timer code for Windows using an equivalent to the Unix.
	gettimeofday().
	- Include some stability changes to the global timer code.
	- Some code clean-ups and remove non-necessary variables.

2006-05-19  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.3

	- Fixed a small bug in the speed meter which made the whole
	progress bar to jump down a line and produced an ugly visual
	effect.

2006-05-15  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.2

	- Improved feedback. Now we have a WGet style progress bar,
	most of the code was stolen from there anyway. The transmission
	speed and estimated time needs some improvements, basically
	stabilize the values.

2005-12-03  etanol  <diptongo@gmail.com>

	* Canute v0.1

	- First stable release with rudimentary feedback.

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
